P = psi - this the the pressure on the projected area of the bearing from the load
V = sfpm - this is the surface speed of the wear surface (surface feet per minute)

Assuming load of 100 N - this is 22 lbs
Long bearing is 3" long, the shorter support on the other end is 3/8" long - total length is 3 3/8"
Shaft is steel, .5" in diameter
Total bearing projected area is 1 11/16 square inches = 1.6875 square inches
Total pressure is therefore 13.04 psi

Bearing material is 932 Bronze (SAE 660)
Max. P = 4000 psi
Max. V = 750 sfpm
Max. PV = 75,000 psi*sfpm

For sleeve (plain) bearings, the surface speed is .262 (pi รท12) x RPM x shaft diameter in inches
Solving for max RPM:
RPM = 750 sfpm / (.5" * .262)

Max. rotational speed is 5,725 RPM
